# Use the same query suites as before
queries:
  - uses: security-extended
  - uses: security-and-quality

# Disable specific rules
query-filters:
  # Disable "Missed opportunity to use Where" - this rule flags valid patterns
  # in ECS code where we intentionally use foreach with conditions instead of
  # LINQ's .Where() for performance reasons (avoiding allocations in hot paths)
